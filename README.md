research-code
=============

this is the code I use for my research.
I use scripts written in Python, Matlab and Gatan's Digital Micrograph scripting language (C++).
For scripts that generate figures I have started saving the figures along side the scripts for viewing.

notes:
- IEP theme customize following [http://blogs.univ-poitiers.fr/laurentsignac/2013/09/01/sublime-dark-iep/]
- for new disto: add 'add_modules_to_syspath.py' to C:/pyzo_dist/lib dir so it can be imported and wills_functions.py module will be accessible.
